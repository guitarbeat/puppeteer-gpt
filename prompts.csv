Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2):
- 2a: Circuit schematic (components, connections, pin assignments, resistor values)
- 2b: Arduino code (sequence, timing, code quality, delay implementation)
- 2c: Implementation (functioning circuit, timing, match with code/schematic)

2a_score: 8.33
2a_comment: Schematic includes all required components (Arduino, red/yellow/green LEDs, resistors), with appropriate safety resistor values presumed. The layout appears complete and safe.

2b_score: 3
2b_comment: Code correctly implements the traffic light sequence with proper timing using blocking `delay()` calls. It is well-commented, with readable structure. However, it does not use non-blocking RTOS-like scheduling principles.

2c_score: 8.33
2c_comment: Video demonstrates two full and accurate traffic light cycles with correct 2s/1s/2s timing, fully matching the schematic and code.

Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2):
- 2a: Circuit schematic (components, connections, pin assignments, resistor values)
- 2b: Arduino code (sequence, timing, code quality, delay implementation)
- 2c: Implementation (functioning circuit, timing, match with code/schematic)

GRADING GUIDANCE:
- Be generous with scoring when evidence is limited
- Make reasonable assumptions where information is incomplete
- Use continuous scoring within the ranges
