Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2) according to the rubric:

1. For 2a (Schematic):
   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements

Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2) according to the rubric:

1. For 2a (Schematic):
   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements
   - Check if the implementation matches the code and schematic

Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2) according to the rubric:

1. For 2a (Schematic):
   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements
   - Check if the implementation matches the code and schematic

Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2) according to the rubric:

1. For 2a (Schematic):
   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements
   - Check if the implementation matches the code and schematic

Please grade the traffic light implementation (Question 2) according to the rubric:

1. For 2a (Schematic):
   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements

1. For 2a (Schematic):
   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements
   - Check if the implementation matches the code and schematic

   - Verify all components are shown (Arduino, three LEDs, resistors)
   - Check for proper connections and pin assignments
   - Confirm resistor values are appropriate for LED safety

2. For 2b (Arduino Code):
   - Verify the traffic light sequence is correctly implemented
   - Check timing (green: 2s, yellow: 1s, red: 2s)
   - Evaluate code quality, comments, and variable names
   - Note if non-blocking delays are used (higher marks)

3. For 2c (Video):
   - Confirm the circuit functions through at least two complete cycles
   - Verify the timing matches requirements
   - Check if the implementation matches the code and schematic
